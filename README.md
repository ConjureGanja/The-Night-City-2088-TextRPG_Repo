   ```

   Then edit `.env.local` and add your Gemini API key:

   ```

   Get your API key from: <https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey>

   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Alternative Setup (No API Key Required)

If you don't want to set up environment variables, you can:

1. Run the app without a `.env.local` file
2. Enter your Gemini API key directly in the app's settings panel
3. The key will be stored locally in your browser

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Freemium Model (Optional)

This game supports a freemium model where users get 5 free AI requests per day using your API key, then can upgrade to premium for unlimited access.

**To enable freemium mode:**

1. Set up the backend API (see [FREEMIUM_SETUP.md](FREEMIUM_SETUP.md))
2. Users automatically get 5 free requests per day
3. After limit is reached, they see an upgrade prompt
4. Premium users get unlimited access

**Benefits:**
- No barrier to entry for new users
- Your API key powers the free tier
- Built-in monetization and upgrade path
